# Open Agent Stack

A comprehensive framework for building, deploying, and governing AI agents with behavioral contracts, communication protocols, and intelligent supervision.

## Overview

The Open Agent Stack consists of four core components:

- **Open Agent Spec (OAS)** - YAML-based specification for declaratively defining AI agents
- **Behavioral Contracts (BCE)** - Runtime enforcement for agent behavior and governance
- **DACP** - Declarative Agent Communication Protocol for structured agent-to-agent communication
- **Shepard** - Intelligent supervision system for monitoring and managing agent lifecycles

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
